This rule finds non-member functions with a superfluous `const` qualifier on their return type.


## Recommendation
The superfluous `const` qualifier should be removed, as it serves no purpose. If the return type contains embedded qualifiers, then care should be taken to remove only the superfluous one.


## Example
{% sample src="ReturnConstType.cpp" %}
