## Recommendation
The solution depends on the reason for the high number of lines:

* If the file's main class is too large, you should refactor it into smaller classes, for example by using the 'Extract Class' refactoring from \[Fowler\].
* If the file's main class contains many nested classes, you should move the nested classes to their own files (in a subsidiary package, where appropriate).
* If the file contains multiple non-public classes in addition to its main class, you should move them into separate files. This is particularly important if they are logically unrelated to the file's main class.
* If the file has been automatically generated by a tool, no changes are required because the file will not be maintained by a programmer.
