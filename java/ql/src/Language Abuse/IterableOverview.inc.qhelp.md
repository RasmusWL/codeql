Java has two interfaces for dealing with iteration, `Iterable<T>` and `Iterator<T>`. An `Iterable<T>` represents a sequence of elements that can be traversed, and an `Iterator<T>` represents the **state** of an ongoing traversal. As an example, all the `Collection<T>` classes in the Java standard library implement `Iterable<T>`. Comparing this to a traditional `for` loop that increments an integer index and iterates over the elements of an array, then the `Iterable<T>` object corresponds to the array, whereas the `Iterator<T>` object corresponds to the index variable.

Implementations of `Iterable<T>` are generally expected to support multiple traversals of the element sequence they represent, although there can be exceptions if the underlying data somehow makes this undesirable, see for example `DirectoryStream<T>`. If an implementation of `Iterable<T>` does not support multiple iterations, then its `iterator()` method should throw an exception on its second and subsequent calls. This makes bugs easier to find if such an `Iterable<T>` is used more than once, for example in two different for-each loops.
