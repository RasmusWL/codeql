When a cipher is used in certain modes such as CBC or GCM, it requires an initialization vector (IV). Under the same secret key, IVs should be unique and ideally unpredictable. If the same IV is used with the same secret key, then the same plaintext results in the same ciphertext. This can let an attacker learn if the same data pieces are transferred or stored, or help the attacker run a dictionary attack.


## Recommendation
Use a random IV generated by `SecureRandom`.


## Example
The following example initializes a cipher with a static IV, which is unsafe:

{% sample src="BadStaticInitializationVector.java" %}
The next example initializes a cipher with a random IV:

{% sample src="GoodRandomInitializationVector.java" %}
