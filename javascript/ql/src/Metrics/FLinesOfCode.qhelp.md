## Recommendation
The solution depends on the reason for the high number of lines:

* If the file contains one or more very large functions, you should decompose them into smaller functions by means of the Extract Function refactoring.
* If the file contains many smaller functions, you should try to split up the file into multiple smaller files.
* If the file has been automatically generated by a tool, no changes are required because the file will not be maintained by a programmer.
