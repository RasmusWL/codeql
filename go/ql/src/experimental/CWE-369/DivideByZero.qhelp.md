In Go, dividing an integer by zero leads to a panic, which might interrupt execution of the program and lead to program termination.


## Recommendation
Check that all user inputs used as a divisor are non-zero. It is also possible to handle a panic, generated by division by zero, using the built-in function `recover`.


## Example
The following example shows data received from user input being used as a divisor and possibly causing a divide-by-zero panic.

{% sample src="DivideByZeroBad.go" %}
This can be fixed by testing the divisor against zero:

{% sample src="DivideByZeroGood.go" %}
