Directly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks. In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.


## Recommendation
To guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.


## Example
The following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:

{% sample src="examples/redirect_bad.py" %}
One way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input against a known fixed string before doing the redirection:

{% sample src="examples/redirect_good.py" %}
